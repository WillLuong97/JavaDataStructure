/* Given an integer n, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 <= x < 10n.
Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 91
Explanation: The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 â‰¤ x < 100, excluding 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99
Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 1


Constraints:

0 <= n <= 8

Approach: append each digit into a number from the range of 0 to 10^n using recursion.
The main function is used to construct the left most digit, to avoid leading 0 and the recursion is used to build the rest of digits
require for the current number. We do this from 0 to 10^n and if the number is unique and still within the boundary, we will increment by 1
and keep repeating the process.

- Backtracking approach: after a each number built, we backtrack and check for another number.

Time complexity: O(10!) worst case, or O(n!) if n < 10.
Space complexity: O(n)
